    "The three supervised learning models that I am going to use for this problem are Naive Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines. I describe each of them and why they are plausible candidates for this dataset below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm that is popular in machine learning because it frequently performs as well as or better than more sophisticated techniques. It is commonly used in text classification (determining out of a collection of texts which texts belong to which group) and medical diagnosis. It is especially useful in performing classification when we have reason to believe that the value of one variable in the dataset tells us little about the value of another variable in the same dataset, and/or when the dataset is high dimensional. Naive Bayes models are simple in the assumptions they make: they assume that each of the attribute variables are probabilistically independent of each other. For example, in the context of this dataset, the probability of being female given that a student graduates and the probability of having Internet access given that a student graduates are independent; and the same relationship holds between all of the variables. Let me make what I just said as clear as possible: the phrase \"...the same relationship holds between all of the variables\" is not a statement about what is actually the case with this dataset. It is a statement about what Naive Bayes ASSUMES to be the case. Again: I am not saying that the relationship of independence DOES hold between all variables, but that the Naive Bayes model assumes this relationship. Even though this may not represent the actual variable relationships, this model seems useful for the data for reasons I'll explain below. Naive Bayes also has the advantage of being computationally faster than most other models, because 1) it has to estimate comparatively few terms (the number of features multiplied by the number of classes), and 2) the probabilities it estimates are one-dimensional, rather than being higher-dimensional and thus requiring more data and more computing time. The weakness of the model comes from the same source as its strength: its strong conditional independence assumption may provide a bad fit to the data if some of the variables actually are dependent on one another. This may lead to model bias - a lack of good fit stemming from the model's inability to capture the contours of the data when certain variables are not probabilistically independent of one another. I chose to use Naive Bayes with this dataset because this dataset is high-dimensional - it has 395 observations and 30 features. Naive Bayes estimates only one-dimensional probabilities, and thus avoids the curse of dimensionality. (That is, not as much data is needed to estimate these one-dimensional probabilities as would be needed for longer joint probabilities.) This is also why Naive Bayes can be trained on relatively small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are often used in operations research to identify a plan that's likely to produce a successful result. They sort the data based on a hierarchical model that is shaped like a tree, starting with a single node and branching out into multiple other nodes, which then do the same, until the tree is complete. The observations in the dataset are contained in the nodes at the ends of the branches at the bottom of the tree. In general, decision trees are useful for implicitly performing variable screening, and for building models that fit data with nonlinear relationships between variables; they're well-liked because they run very quickly and are easy to interpret. Decision trees are built from splitting the data into categories at each node based on their value for a single variable. At each level of the tree, these splits are made to maximize \"information gain\" - a measure of how well the data are sorted after the split compared to before. Decision trees have the advantage of being relatively easy to understand and visualize, but are prone to overfitting the training data. A weakness of decision trees is that they are quite sensitive to noise in the data and are very prone to overfitting the training set; this usually has to be compensated for by either restricting how specific a tree can become in its lower branches, or by pruning a completed tree. Care must be used to avoid making too many splits in the tree, as doing so may lead to a tree that fits the observed data well but generalizes to new data poorly. I chose decision trees for this dataset because splitting by information gain seems like an intiuitive way to approach a classification problem where we have 1) a large number of variables, and 2) little up-front idea of which ones might be most important. A graph of the tree would provide a good visualization of what factors make it more likely that a student will fail to graduate, and would show them in order of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector machines are often used with high-dimensional data (making them popular in bioinformatics or image detection), and/or with data where nonlinear relationships exist between the variables. They are often used in life sciences to identify proteins, or in text mining to identify hand-written characters. SVMs estimate a decision boundary between points of one class and points of another, based on higher-dimensional separating hyperplanes between the points. These boundaries are created primarily based on the variable differences between points of different classes that are closest to one another. The name of the model comes from the way that the hyperplane is constructed - support vectors are the points closest to the supporting hyperplane, and they determine its shape. The movement of one of these points even by a small amount can change the decision boundary significantly. Conversely, points which are farther away from the space(s) between different classes are given much less weight (often none, for practical purposes) in determining the shape of the hyperplane. Support vector machines make predictions based on what side of the decision boundary testing points fall, with one side representing one of the classes and the other side representing the other class. If the points of the two classes are linearly separable, the hyperplane will take the form of a line when projected into two-dimensional space. If the classes are not linearly separable (if there is no line that can be drawn between points of both classes in two-dimensional space that perfectly separates them), a non-linear kernel can be used for the hyperplane, that will take the form of some sort of curve when projected into two-dimensional space. The advantage of support vector machines for this dataset is that they are designed specifically for binary classification, which is what we're trying to do with this data. Additionally, they're useful in teasing out the small differences between students who graduate and those who don't, because of the weight they give in constructing the decision boundary to those small differences between students in the two classes who are otherwise similar. A disadvantage comes from the curse of dimensionality: the separating hyperplane may be very high-dimensional, and the number of data points needed to estimate the hyperplane grows exponentially with the number of dimensions.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "To determine which model we should use, we need to know which one consistently gives the best F1 test score. The F1 score is the weighted average of the model's precision (the probability, given the model's classification, that a data point is actually in the predicted class) and recall (the probability, given that the data is in a given class, that the model classifies it correctly). It works as a measure of how well the model classifies data, and ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 being worst and 1 being best. We look at the F1 test score rather than the F1 train score because the latter is prone to overfitting; it may be artificially inflated because the model has already seen the data by which it's making a prediction. The F1 test score is a better approximation to how the model performs with unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three considerations that need to be made. First, which model has the best F1 test score overall when trained on the full training data (300)? Second, which model gives the most consistent F1 score for the different training sizes? The second consideration is important because the actual population of students may be much larger than the given 395, and we need to know whether our model is likely to fluctuate widely in its predictions based on the size of the training set, especially since getting data on the majority of a large school may be unfeasible. Sampling students may be costly, and so we need to know that the model will be relatively consistent in the quality of its predictions even if our training set is smaller than ideal. Third, which model has the best computational run-time? Depending on the size of the sample and the number of variables, run-time might make a difference in how easy the analysis to perform. By the first two metrics, the support vector machine (SVM) model is clearly the best. It has the highest overall F1 score on the full training data, and is much more consistent in its score across the training set sizes than the decision tree or naive Bayes models. The lower F1 scores of those two models indicate that they are not as good a fit to the data, and the variability of their F1 scores by data size indicates that they are more sensitive to the size of the sample than the support vector model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When taking time into account, the SVM model is slower (on average, by a factor of 10) than the decision tree or Naive Bayes models on training prediction time, and slightly slower (but about 0.0001 seconds on average) than these models in the testing prediction time. However, this does not provide reason for rejecting the SVM model in favor of one of the other two. All of the models differ in runtime by less than the tenth part of a second. If the school expected to be using a very large (say, 10,000+ students) dataset, and/or had very slow computers available, it might be preferable to use the decision tree classifier. But neither of these seem likely; given limited resources, it's very improbable that the sample size will be large enough to actually slow down an average computer by more than a few seconds. Runtime is a more important issue when dealing with large datasets, but 395 observations is not nearly large enough to justify prioritizing runtime over F1 score, especially when the runtime difference is miniscule. I conclude that the SVM model seems to be the best for this data.\n",

If the available points are graphed in two-dimensional space, the decision boundary is the line or curve that best separates the points by their classes. The decision boundary is constructed primarily based on the points of different classes which are closest to one another: for instance, if a student who is known to have not graduated falls close on the graph to a student who did graduate, the differences in variable values between these two students will be given much more weight in constructing the decision boundary than the differences between failing and graduating students who differed widely in most respects. The boundary gives the greatest weight to the small differences between data points that are otherwise similar.\n",

    "The final F1 score for training is 0.8528, and the F1 score for testing is 0.8212. These are the same values that were achieved by the untuned model, which indicates that the SVC's default values for C and kernel (1.0 and \"rbf\", respectively) were already best suited to this problem. Even though the F1 scores for the tuned model are the same, this does not mean that tuning was superfluous - the default values may be best (there's a reason why they're set as the defaults), but until we've tuned the parameters, we don't know for sure if they are. Tuning the model like I did above gives us better confidence in the fit of the model, even if the F1 scores are the same."
